# HiKeeper

HiKeeper is a Vim plugin that helps you persist and customize your syntax highlighting.

## Description

Have you ever wanted to change the syntax highlighting of a certain group of elements in your Vim environment and persist it across colorschemes, but found it difficult and time-consuming to do so? HiKeeper makes it easy for you to customize your syntax highlighting by allowing you to define your own highlight groups and properties.

HiKeeper also automatically applies your customized highlight groups at startup or manually whenever you choose to apply them.
